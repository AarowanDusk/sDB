## Local JSON/Text to CML Database (Small Scale)

This project provides a lightweight local database solution for storing JSON files or plain text data in CML (Crystallographic Markup Language) format. Ideal for small-scale datasets and personal use cases.

**Features:**

* **Simple JSON/Text Storage:** Easily store your JSON or text data in a structured manner for efficient retrieval and management.
* **CML Conversion:** Convert the stored data into CML format, making it interoperable with crystallographic software and workflows.
* **Local Focus:** Designed for local storage, keeping your data under your control without relying on external servers.

**Benefits:**

* **Organization:** Organize your data effectively using the structure of JSON or text files.
* **CML Compatibility:** Leverage the benefits of CML for crystallographic data analysis.
* **Offline Accessibility:** Work with your data even without an internet connection.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository: `[git clone https://github.com/your-username/local-json-cml-db.git](https://github.com/AarowanDusk/sDB.git)` (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username)
2. Follow the setup instructions included in the README file.

**Target Audience:**

* Researchers working with crystallographic data who need a local solution for storing and converting JSON/text files to CML format.
* Developers interested in exploring light-weight database solutions for specific data formats.
